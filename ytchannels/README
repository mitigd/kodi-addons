Youtube Channels is a support addon for Kodi's unnoficial Youtube addon. With this, you can easily create folders and within those folders 
hold as many subscriptions as you desire. It's entirely up to you.

Features:
1) Create folders: This allows for an easier access to subscriptions that adhere to what your currently interested in viewing.
2) If a folder is named 'Live', the addon will only show currently live streaming broadcasts. Good for 24/7 Youtube channels.
3) You don't need an account as your subs are saved in your local Kodi addon userdata directory, in a 'favs' file.
